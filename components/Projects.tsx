This service in turn enabled competitive VEXU robots to compete fully autonomously in real time against robots from other universities.",
        "My primary contributions to the project were on the computer vision pipeline. For this pipeline, we used a YOLOv5 object identification model that was trained on 500+ hand-labeled images using the Milwaukee School of Engineering's super computer. Inference for this model was run on-robot on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Once bounding boxes of objects were identified, ROS2 TF2 was used with the depth information to transform the object vectors to the coordinate frame of the field.",
        "In addition to this project being chosen to be presented on to the the Wisconsin Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE-WI), it also won first place at the Rosie Super Computer Challenge and contributed to the Raider Robotics organization winning the second most prestegious award in their division at the 2022 VEXU world championship."],

        "Collabify is an open-source web application that allows its users to easily discover all of the songs their favorite artists have collaborated on. To achieve this, a user will first authorize the app to access their user data through the Spotify Authentication page. Once authorized, Collabify will retrieve their followed artist information, present it to the user, and prompt them to select any combination of artists they would like to view all collaborations for. Once these artists have been selected, a WebSocket is opened with the backend API written in Go and the artist IDs are passed through it as a list. Next, for every artist, the API creates a Goroutine. In each of these Goroutines, the discography of the artist is retrieved through the Spotify API and the artists from every song with multiple artists are compared against a map that contains all of the artists that the user initially selected. Whenever a featured artist on a track is found within the map, that track is sent back to the frontend via the WebSocket.",
        "In the frontend, a live interactive 3d graph is being created for the user as the tracks are found. This graph contains artists as its nodes and links between artists that have dynamic sizes which change based on how many tracks the artists have collaborated on together on. The user can then hover over the links between any artists to open a modal in the corner that shows all of the tracks between those two artists. Once all tracks have been discovered, the WebSocket closes and a final modal automatically opens that displays quick statistics, such as how many tracks were found between how many artists, and who the top five artist pairs were who had the most collabs. Lastly, the user can click a button to create a playlist in their Spotify account containing all the discovered tracks.",

        modalDescription: ["This project was done in collaboration with a self-managed team of 7 students and the Milwaukee School of Engineering's AI Club. We research the problem of detecting lymphocytes in hyperspectral images of ovarian biopsies from ovarian cancer patients. The intention of localizing lymphocytes in these biopsies was to contribute to future research in making human-understandable ovarian cancer classification models. The novelty of our research was from the images in our dataset being scanned using a state-of-the-art Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) machine, which provided us with 396 bands of information to analyze.",
                            "Our experimental process began with labeling the data and learning more about working with hyperspectral imaging by evaluating classical supervised machine learning methods such as SVMs, KNN, Naïve Bayes, etc. From there, our experiments shifted to using Tensorflow to architect CNNs for lymphocyte classification as well as experimenting with PCA to assist in the process of data labeling. In addition to the outcomes that can be seen in the attached research paper, we were accepted to speak at two conferences about our outcomes and won second place for best student-authored paper at the Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium (MICS)."],

The foundation of the website was built by one of the team members for their previous competitive robotics teams, however, porting the dashboard to a different competitive robotics environment created many issues with its underlying logic. I and other members of the Raider Robotics organization have fixed many of these issues and contributed other new features to the dashboard's functionality such as customization of robot profiles and undo-redo stacks."],

Over the span of 3 months I created lecture material guides for professors and developed hands-on exercises for students. These materials were made using both my prior industry experience with blockchain as well as from independent research on the technology.",
        "The lecture material included everything from the fundamentals of blockchain as a data structure, to advanced topics pertaining to public blockchain networks and smart contracts. The exercises I created included Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate atomic blockchain topics such as hashing, creating a cryptocurrency and associated public blockchain network from scratch using python and flask, and creating and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum network that follow the ERC20 and ERC721 standards.",
        "After developing the course I also was accepted to give a presentation at the Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium (MICS) regional conference on the insights I made while creating it."],

The project had two primary goals. The first goal was to investigate how the severity of lesions to glomeruli can be objectively assessed given kidney cross-sections, and the second goal was to create a pipeline that would assist renal pathologists in their work of detecting glomeruli damage in kidneys. To achieve both of these objectives, we implemented and experimented with multiple approaches including but not limited to Convolution Neural Networks, Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis."],

        modalDescription: ["This project was done to learn and apply knowledge of Nvidia's CUDA toolkit by applying parallelization to two widely used encryption algorithms, RSA and AES. The group I worked with on this project started by initially writing the encryption algorithms serially in C, using existing C++ implementations of the algorithms as reference. From there, CUDA was used to parallelize them. Both serial and parallel implementations of the algorithms were then profiled, using an Intel i5 6600K and an Nvidia RTX 2080, to calculate the parallelization speedup which can be seen in the figures above."],
